# Html for Noobs
## What is an element?
&emsp;HTML code is made up of elements that, which are things like paragraphs, images, etc. A basic html element is formatted like this.
```html
<tag>Contents</tag>
```
&emsp;`<tag>` starts the element, and `</tag>` ends it. The contents of that element come in between, and you can even put more html elements inside! "`tag`" isn't a real html element type, but there are different kinds of these, like `<p>` for paragraphs, `<a>` for links, and others. 

&emsp;Some elements dont need ending tags since they can't have any content inside them.  Like `<br>` and `<img>`.

## What kinds of elements are there?
&emsp;There are many kinds of elements, but the ones that you will use commonly will be pretty memorable.  
&emsp;As mentioned before, the `<p>` tag is for paragraphs. You can put a `<br>` inside one to make a new line. (Remember: `<br>` doesnt need a `</br>`.)
```html
<p>Hello World!</p>
```
`<h1>`, `<h2>`, and all the way to `<h6>` are formatted just like this, but they are meant for headings. `<h1>` is the biggest, and `<h6>` is the smallest.
